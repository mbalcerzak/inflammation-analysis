# Purpose of the repo

A data management system that deals with clinical trial data used in a clinical trial on inflammation.

## Main feautures
- Basic statistical analysis over clinical trial data
- Ability to work on data in .csv format
- Generate plots

## Tests

The tests should be run using `pytest`

## Prerequisites
Inflam requires the following Python packages:

- [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/) - makes use of NumPy's statistical functions
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) - uses Matplotlib to generate statistical plots

The following optional packages are required to run Inflam's unit tests:

- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) - Inflam's unit tests are written using pytest
- [pytest-cov](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/) - Adds test coverage stats to unit testing
